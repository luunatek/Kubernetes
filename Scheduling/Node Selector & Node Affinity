Node Selector:
nodeSelector - is the simplest recommended form of node selection constraint. nodeSelector is a field of PodSpec. 
You can constrain a Pod to only be able to run on particular Node(s) , or to prefer to run on particular nodes.
There are some circumstances where you may want more control on a node where a pod lands, e.g. to ensure that a pod ends up 
on a machine with an SSD attached to it, or to co-locate pods from two different services that communicate 
a lot into the same availability zone.

Label nodes:
  $ kubectl label nodes <node-name> <label-key>=<label-value>
  $ kubectl label nodes node01 size=large

>>> Note: On NodeSelectot you can not provide advanced expression: OR/NOT (Medium OR Large; Not small)
>>> Node Selector vs Node Affinity:

nodeSelector - provides a very simple way to constrain pods to nodes with particular labels. 
The affinity/anti-affinity feature, greatly expands the types of constraints you can express. 
The key enhancements are:
  - the language is more expressive (not just “AND of exact match”)
  - you can indicate that the rule is “soft”/“preference” rather than a hard requirement, so if the scheduler can’t satisfy it, 
    the pod will still be scheduled
  - you can constrain against labels on other pods running on the node (or other topological domain), rather than against labels
    on the node itself, which allows rules about which pods can and cannot be co-located

Node Affinity:
Node affinity - is conceptually similar to nodeSelector – it allows you to constrain which nodes your pod is eligible to be 
scheduled on, based on labels on the node.

There are currently two types of node affinity:
Available:
  - requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
  - preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
Planned:
  - requiredDuringSchedulingRequiredDuringExecution
