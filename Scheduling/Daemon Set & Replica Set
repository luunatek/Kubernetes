A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod. As nodes are added to the cluster, Pods are added to them. 
As nodes are removed from the cluster, those Pods are garbage collected. Deleting a DaemonSet will clean up the Pods it created.

Some typical uses of a DaemonSet are:
  - running a cluster storage daemon, such as glusterd, ceph, on each node.
  - running a logs collection daemon on every node, such as fluentd or logstash.
  - running a node monitoring daemon on every node, such as Prometheus Node Exporter, Sysdig Agent, collectd, Dynatrace 
  OneAgent, AppDynamics Agent, Datadog agent, New Relic agent, Ganglia gmond or Instana Agent.
